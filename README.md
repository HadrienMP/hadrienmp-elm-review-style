# hadrienmp-elm-review-style

This is my personal elm preference compilation.

It is subject to changing based on comments. If you try it, let me know what you think. If you change it for your taste I'd like to have a look also!

## Use it in your project
You could use git submodules but I suggest you use [git subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo).
```bash
git subrepo clone git@github.com:HadrienMP/hadrienmp-elm-review-style.git review
```

If you have elm-review installed, you're done !
